The Inverted Pendulum is my personal project after graduating from university.
It uses an STM32F102C8T6 to compute and control all the devices.
I built several functions, such as PID_Calculate, Read_Encoder, and DC_Motor_Control, using KeilC with the C programming language.
This is my video about the Inverted Pendulum on YouTube. Please click the link below.
